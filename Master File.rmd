### Problem 1: Read in and Prepare Data
```{r PR}
Fish <- read.csv("fish.csv")
Fish$Site <- factor(Fish$Site)
Fish$AgeP<- factor(Fish$AgeP)
count(Fish)
Fish2 <- Fish[which(Fish$YrCaught==Fish$YrTagged),] #this is our new data set for the rest of the assignment
Total <- count(Fish2)
weight <- sum(is.na(Fish$Weight)) #filter out missing values for Weight
age <- sum(is.na(Fish$AgeP)) #filter out missing values for Age
site <- sum(is.na(Fish$Site)) #filter out missing values for Site
length <- sum(is.na(Fish$Length)) #filter out missing values for Length
#print table with Fish2, number of missing values for weight, age, length and site -> Omit YrCaught and YrTagged from this table
Fish2 %>%
  count(count(Fish2), weight, age, site, length)
```



### Problem 3:  EDA
#### Part 3a)
```{r Univariate EDA}
#graph for Age, Weight and Length each
h1 <- ggplot(Fish2, aes(x = AgeP)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "cornflowerblue") + 
  ylim(0,3500) + 
  labs(x = "Probable Age", 
       title = "Fish Measured Age 0-3") #right skewed unimodal
h2 <- ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Length)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
                 fill = "cornflowerblue") + 
  labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Length", 
       x = "Length in mm") #right skewed bimodal
h3 <- ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
                 fill = "cornflowerblue") + 
  ylim(0,50) + 
  labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Weight", 
       x = "Weight in grams") #right skewed bimodal
ggarrange(h1, h2, h3)
summary(Fish2$Weight)
summary(Fish2$Length)
summary(Fish2$AgeP)

```

#### Part 3b)
```{r Bivariate EDA}
#graph for relationship between weight and length
ggplot(Fish2, 
       aes(x = Length, 
           y = Weight)) +
   geom_point(color="cornflowerblue", 
             size = 2, 
             alpha=.8) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(50, 210, 20),
                     limits=c(50,210)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10),
                     limits=c(0,100)) + 
  labs(title = "Fish Measured Weight on Measured Length", 
       x = "Length in mm", 
       y = "Weight in grams")
summary(Fish2$Length, Fish2$Weight)
```

### Problem 4:  Regression of Weight on Length
#### Part 4a)
```{r Scatterplot}
ggplot(Fish2, 
       aes(x = log(Length), 
           y = log(Weight))) +
   geom_point(color="cornflowerblue", 
             size = 2, 
             alpha=.8) + 
  labs(title = "Fish Measured Weight on Measured Length", 
       x = "Natural Log of Length in mm", 
       y = "Natural Log of Weight in grams")
```

#### Part 4b)
```{r Reg W on L}
ggplot(Fish2, 
       aes(x = log(Length), 
           y = log(Weight))) +
   geom_point(color="cornflowerblue", 
             size = 2, 
             alpha=.8) + 
  labs(title = "Fish Measured Weight on Measured Length", 
       x = "Natural Log of Length in mm", 
       y = "Natural Log of Weight in grams") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black")
