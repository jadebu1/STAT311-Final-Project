### Problem 1: Read in and Prepare Data
```{r PR}
Fish <- read.csv("fish.csv")
Fish$Site <- factor(Fish$Site)
Fish$AgeP<- factor(Fish$AgeP)
count(Fish)
Fish2 <- Fish[which(Fish$YrCaught==Fish$YrTagged),] #this is our new data set for the rest of the assignment
Total <- count(Fish2)
weight <- sum(is.na(Fish$Weight)) #filter out missing values for Weight
age <- sum(is.na(Fish$AgeP)) #filter out missing values for Age
site <- sum(is.na(Fish$Site)) #filter out missing values for Site
length <- sum(is.na(Fish$Length)) #filter out missing values for Length
#print table with Fish2, number of missing values for weight, age, length and site -> Omit YrCaught and YrTagged from this table
Fish2 %>%
  count(count(Fish2), weight, age, site, length)
```



### Problem 3:  EDA
#### Part 3a)
```{r Univariate EDA}
#graph for Age, Weight and Length each
h1 <- ggplot(Fish2, aes(x = AgeP)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "cornflowerblue") + ylim(0,3500) + labs(x = "Probable Age", title = "Fish Measured Age 0-3")
h2 <- ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Length)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "cornflowerblue") + labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Length", x = "Length in mm")
h3 <- ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "cornflowerblue") + ylim(0,50) + labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Weight", x = "Weight in grams")
ggarrange(h1, h2, h3)
```

#### Part 3b)
```{r Bivariate EDA}
#graph for relationship between weight and length
ggplot(Fish2, 
       aes(x = Length, 
           y = Weight)) +
   geom_point(color="cornflowerblue", 
             size = 2, 
             alpha=.8) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(50, 225, 25),
                     limits=c(50,250)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10),
                     limits=c(0,100)) + 
  labs(title = "Fish Measured Weight by Measured Length", x = "Length in mm", y = "Weight in grams")
```
