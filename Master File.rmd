### Problem 1: Read in and Prepare Data
```{r PR}
Fish <- read.csv("fish.csv")
Fish$Site <- factor(Fish$Site)
Fish$AgeP<- factor(Fish$AgeP)
count(Fish)
Fish2 <- Fish[which(Fish$YrCaught==Fish$YrTagged),] #this is our new data set for the rest of the assignment
Total <- count(Fish2)
weight <- sum(is.na(Fish$Weight)) #filter out missing values for Weight
age <- sum(is.na(Fish$AgeP)) #filter out missing values for Age
site <- sum(is.na(Fish$Site)) #filter out missing values for Site
length <- sum(is.na(Fish$Length)) #filter out missing values for Length
#print table with Fish2, number of missing values for weight, age, length and site -> Omit YrCaught and YrTagged from this table
Fish2 %>%
  count(count(Fish2), weight, age, site, length)
```



### Problem 3:  EDA
#### Part 3a)
```{r Univariate EDA}
#graph for Age, Weight and Length each
ggplot(Fish2, aes(x = AgeP)) +
  geom_bar() + ylim(0,3500) + labs(x = "Age", title = "Fish Measured Age 0-3")
ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Length)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Length")
ggplot(data = Fish2, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) + ylim(0,50) + labs(title = "Captured Fish Measured Weight")
```

#### Part 3b)
```{r Bivariate EDA}
#graph for relationship between weight and length
ggplot(Fish2, 
       aes(x = Length, 
           y = Weight)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Fish Measured Weight by Measured Length")
```

### Problem 4:  Regression of Weight on Length
#### Part 4a)
```{r Scatterplot}

```

#### Part 4b)
```{r Reg W on L}

```


#### Part 4c)
```{r Reg Diagnostics}

```


#### Part 4e)
```{r Beta1 EQ 3}

```



#### Part 4f)
```{r CI and PI}

```


### Problem 5:  Fish Length and Site
#### Part 5a)
```{r FL by Site}

```

#### Part 5b)
```{r Inference for Length}

```


### Problem 6: Probable Age Class 2 by Site
#### Part 6a)
```{r AgeP 2 by Site}

```

#### Part 6b)
```{r CI P6}

```

#### Part 6c)
```{r HT P6}

```
